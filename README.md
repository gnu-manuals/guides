## Emacs

Emacs is the extensible, customizable, self-documenting real-time
display editor. You can run Emacs in the terminal with no window or use
the GUI version.

Perhaps the most standard Emacs command line option is outputing the version info with:

```
$ emacs --version
GNU Emacs 29.3

```

A great way to open Emacs and jump straight into a buffer for Lisp evaluation is to run:

`$ emacs --no-splash`

Just enter some Lisp commands for evaluation and execute with `Control-J`.
